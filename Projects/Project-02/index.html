When the three-dimensional is converted to the two-dimensional, the laws of perspective give rise to a conflicting relationship.</p>

                <p>The work is composed of more than 800 "bird" characters written in different styles of Square World Calligraphy—an innovative form of writing designed by Xu Bing. In a concise form, the artwork is inspiring, compelling viewers to contemplate the significance of words, concepts, knowledge, symbols, and images.</p>

                <p>This work is composed of more than 400 "bird" characters made of different scripts. The text in the center of the exhibition hall is taken from the dictionary's explanation of the word "bird". Starting from this text, the "bird" character began to fly, evolving from the simplified printed form after Mao Zedong to the traditional form, regular script, official script, and small seal script, and finally tracing back to the ancient pictographic "bird".</p>

                <p>These thousands of “characters” look like real Chinese characters, but are actually “pseudo-characters” created by the artist. The extremely sophisticated production process makes it hard to believe that these beautiful “books” can't actually read any content. Both attract and block people's desire to read.</p>
